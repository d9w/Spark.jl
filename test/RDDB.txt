I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by
madness, starving hysterical naked,
dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn
looking for an angry fix,
angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly
connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,
who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat
up smoking in the supernatural darkness of
cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities
contemplating jazz,
who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and
saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,
who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes
hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy
among the scholars of war,
who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on
the windows of the skull,
who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear,
burning their money in wastebaskets and listening
to the Terror through the wall,
who got busted in their pubic beards returning through
Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York,
who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in
Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night with
dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares,
alcohol and cock and endless balls,
incomparable blind; streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind
leaping toward poles of Canada & Paterson,
illuminating all the motionless world of Time between,
Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery
dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops,
storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon
blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter
dusks of Brooklyn,
ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind,
who chained themselves to subways for the endless
ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine
until the noise of wheels and children brought
them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of
brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,
who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford's floated out and sat
through the stale beer after
noon in desolate Fugazzi's, listening to the crack
of doom on the hydrogen jukebox,
who talked continuously seventy hours from park to
pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,
lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping
down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills
off Empire State out of the moon,
yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts
and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks
and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,
whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days
and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the
Synagogue cast on the pavement,
who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a
trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall,
suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grind-ings and
migraines of China under junk-with-drawal in Newark's bleak furnished room,
who wandered around and around at midnight in the
railroad yard wondering where to go, and went,
leaving no broken hearts,
who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing
through snow toward lonesome farms in grand-father night,
who studied Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telepathy
and bop kabbalah because the cosmos instinctively
vibrated at their feet in Kansas,
who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary
indian angels who were visionary indian angels,
who thought they were only mad when Baltimore
gleamed in supernatural ecstasy, who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of
Oklahoma on the impulse of winter midnight street
light smalltown rain,
who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston
seeking jazz or sex or soup, and followed the
brilliant Spaniard to converse about America
and Eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship to Africa,
who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving
behind nothing but the shadow of dungarees
and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in fireplace Chicago,
who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the
F.B.I. in beards and shorts with big pacifist
eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incomprehensible leaflets,
who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting
the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism,
who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union
Square weeping and undressing while the sirens
of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed
down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,
who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked
and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons,
who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight
in policecars for committing no crime but their
own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication,
who howled on their knees in the subway and were
dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts,
who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly
motorcyclists, and screamed with joy,
who blew and were blown by those human seraphim,
the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love, who balled in the
morning in the evenings in rose
gardens and the grass of public parks and
cemeteries scattering their semen freely to
whomever come who may,
who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up
with a sob behind a partition in a Turkish Bath
when the blond & naked angel came to pierce
them with a sword,
who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate
the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar
the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb
and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but
sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden
threads of the craftsman's loom,
who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of beer a sweetheart a
package of cigarettes a candle and fell off the bed, and continued along
the floor and down the hall and ended fainting
on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and
come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness,
who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling
in the sunset, and were red eyed in the morning but prepared to sweeten the
snatch of the sun
rise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the lake,
who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad
stolen night-cars, N.C., secret hero of these
poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver-joy
to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls
in empty lots & diner backyards, moviehouses'
 rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or with gaunt waitresses in familiar
 roadside lonely petticoat upliftings & especially secret gas-station
 solipsisms of johns, & hometown alleys too,
 who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in
 dreams, woke on a sudden Manhattan, and picked themselves up out of basements
 hung
 over with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third
 Avenue iron dreams & stumbled to unemployment offices,
 who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on
 the snowbank docks waiting for a door in the
 East River to open to a room full of steamheat and opium,
 who created great suicidal dramas on the apartment
 cliff-banks of the Hudson under the wartime
 blue floodlight of the moon & their heads shall
 be crowned with laurel in oblivion,
 who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested
 the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of Bowery,
 who wept at the romance of the streets with their
 pushcarts full of onions and bad music,
 who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the
 bridge, and rose up to build harpsichords in their lofts,
 who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned
 with flame under the tubercular sky surrounded
 by orange crates of theology,
 who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty
 incantations which in the yellow morning were
 stanzas of gibberish,
 who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht
 & tortillas dreaming of the pure vegetable kingdom,
 who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an egg,
 who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot
 for Eternity outside of Time, & alarm clocks
 fell on their heads every day for the next decade, who cut their wrists three
 times successively unsuccessfully, gave up and were forced to open antique
 stores where they thought they were growing old and cried,
 who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits
 on Madison Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse
 & the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments
 of fashion & the nitroglycerine shrieks of the
 fairies of advertising & the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or
 were run down by the
 drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality, who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this
 actually happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze
 of Chinatown soup alley
 ways & firetrucks, not even one free beer,
 who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of
 the subway window, jumped in the filthy Passaic, leaped on negroes,
 cried all over the street,
 danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed phonograph records of nostalgic
 European 1930s German jazz finished the whiskey and
 threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans
 in their ears and the blast of colossal steam whistles,
 who barreled down the highways of the past journeying
 to each other's hotrod-Golgotha jail-solitude
 watch or Birmingham jazz incarnation,
 who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out
 if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had
 a vision to find out Eternity,
 who journeyed to Denver, who died in Denver, who
 came back to Denver & waited in vain, who
 watched over Denver & brooded & loned in
 Denver and finally went away to find out the Time, & now Denver is lonesome
 for her heroes,
 who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying
 for each other's salvation and light and breasts,
 until the soul illuminated its hair for a second,
 who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for
 impossible criminals with golden heads and the
 charm of reality in their hearts who sang sweet
 blues to Alcatraz,
 who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky
 Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to boys
 or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or
 Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave, who demanded
 sanity trials accusing the radio of hyp
 notism & were left with their insanity & their
 hands & a hung jury,
 who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism
 and subsequently presented themselves on the
 granite steps of the madhouse with shaven heads
 and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding instantaneous lobotomy,
 and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin
 Metrazol electricity hydrotherapy psychotherapy occupational
 therapy pingpong & amnesia,
 who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table, resting
 briefly in catatonia,
 returning years later truly bald except for a wig of blood, and tears and
 fingers, to the visible mad
 man doom of the wards of the madtowns of the East,
 Pilgrim State's Rockland's and Greystone's foetid
 halls, bickering with the echoes of the soul,
 rocking and rolling in the midnight solitude-bench
 dolmen-realms of love, dream of life a nightmare,
 bodies turned to stone as heavy as the moon,
 with mother finally ******, and the last fantastic book
 flung out of the tenement window, and the last
 door closed at 4. A.M. and the last telephone
 slammed at the wall in reply and the last furnished room
 emptied down to the last piece of mental furniture,
 a yellow paper rose twisted on a wire hanger in the closet, and even that
 imaginary, nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination
 ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and now you're really in the
 total animal soup of time
 and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed
 with a sudden flash of the alchemy of the use of the ellipse the catalog the
 meter & the vibrating plane,
 who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time & Space
 through images juxtaposed, and trapped the
 archangel of the soul between 2 visual images
 and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun
 and dash of consciousness together jumping
 with sensation of Pater Omnipotens Aeterna Deus
 to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human
 prose and stand before you speechless and intelligent
 and shaking with shame,
 rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm
 of thought in his naked and endless head,
 the madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown,
 yet putting down here what might be left to say
 in time come after death,
 and rose reincarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in
 the goldhorn shadow of the band and blew the
 suffering of America's naked mind for love into
 an eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone
 cry that shivered the cities down to the last radio
 with the absolute heart of the poem of life butchered out of their own bodies
 good to eat a thousand years.
 What sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open
 their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?  Moloch! Solitude!
 Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unob
 tainable dollars! Children screaming under the
 stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men
 weeping in the parks!
 Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the
 loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy
 judger of men!
 Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the
 crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of
 sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment!
 Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!
 Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose
 blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers
 are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo!
 Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!
 Moloch whose eyes are a thousand blind windows!
 Moloch whose skyscrapers stand in the long
 streets like endless Jehovahs! Moloch whose factories
 dream and croak in the fog! Moloch whose smokestacks and antennae crown the
 cities!
 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch
 whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch
 whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch
 whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen!
 Moloch whose name is the Mind!
 Moloch in whom I sit lonely! Moloch in whom I dream
 Angels! Crazy in Moloch! Cocksucker in
 Moloch! Lacklove and manless in Moloch!
 Moloch who entered my soul early! Moloch in whom
 I am a consciousness without a body! Moloch
 who frightened me out of my natural ecstasy!
 Moloch whom I abandon! Wake up in Moloch!
 Light streaming out of the sky!
 Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs!
 skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic
 industries! spectral nations! invincible mad
 houses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!  They broke their backs lifting
 Moloch to Heaven! Pave-
 ments, trees, radios, tons! lifting the city to
 Heaven which exists and is everywhere about us!
 Visions! omens! hallucinations! miracles! ecstasies!
 gone down the American river!
 Dreams! adorations! illuminations! religions! the whole boatload of sensitive
 bullshit!
 Breakthroughs! over the river! flips and crucifixions!
 gone down the flood! Highs! Epiphanies! Despairs!
 Ten years' animal screams and suicides!  Minds! New loves! Mad generation!
 down on the rocks of Time!
 Real holy laughter in the river! They saw it all! the
 wild eyes! the holy yells! They bade farewell!
 They jumped off the roof! to solitude! waving!  carrying flowers! Down to the
 river! into the street!

 where your condition has become serious and
 is reported on the radio

 where the faculties of the skull no longer admit
 the worms of the senses

 where you drink the tea of the breasts of the
 spinsters of Utica
 I'm with you in Rockland

 harpies of the Bronx
 I'm with you in Rockland
 where you scream in a straightjacket that you're
 losing the game of the actual pingpong of the abyss
 I'm with you in Rockland
 where you bang on the catatonic piano the soul
 is innocent and immortal it should never die
 ungodly in an armed madhouse
 I'm with you in Rockland
 where fifty more shocks will never return your
 soul to its body again from its pilgrimage to a
 cross in the void
 I'm with you in Rockland

 fascist national Golgotha
 I'm with you in Rockland

 and resurrect your living human Jesus from the
 superhuman tomb I'm with you in Rockland where there are twenty-five-thousand
 mad com-
 rades all together singing the final stanzas of
 the Internationale
 I'm with you in Rockland
 where we hug and kiss the United States under
 our bedsheets the United States that coughs all
 night and won't let us sleep
 I'm with you in Rockland
 where we wake up electrified out of the coma
 by our own souls' airplanes roaring over the
 roof they've come to drop angelic bombs the
 hospital illuminates itself imaginary walls collapse O skinny legions run
 outside O starry
 spangled shock of mercy the eternal war is
 here O victory forget your underwear we're free I'm with you in Rockland in
 my dreams you walk dripping from a sea-
 journey on the highway across America in tears to the door of my cottage in
 the Western night
